# My Py3 Game
A little text-based adventure game I made while learning Python

## Objective
The aim is to explore three rooms, collecting a gem from each which allows you to unlock the treasure chest. Choose wisely, as the wrong decision may lead to your death... :skull:

 ### How to play
 Open the file `main.py` in your console of choice.
 Also try out `main_classes.py` for my rewrite using classes!`
